# Microsoft_PowerBI_Superstone_Project


The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of the Superstone sales dataset using Microsoft Power BI. Superstone is a fictional company that sells various products, including furniture, office supplies, and technology equipment. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, product categories, sales amounts, and other related information.


- For this project, please find attached the dataset in [Superstone Sales Data.xlsx](https://github.com/mahyarsab/Microsoft_PowerBI_Superstone_Project/blob/main/Superstone%20Sales%20Data.xlsx) and, the main project file is [Mahyar_PowerBI_Project.pbix(Microsoft Power Bi file)](https://github.com/mahyarsab/Microsoft_PowerBI_Superstone_Project/blob/main/Mahyar_PowerBI_Project.pbix).

The project involves the following steps:

- Data Preparation and Cleansing: In this step, I import the Superstone sales dataset into Power BI and perform some basic data preparation and cleansing tasks to ensure the data is accurate and consistent. I also create relationships between the tables to enable cross-table analysis.

- Data Modeling: In this step, I use Power BI's data modeling tools to create calculated columns and measures that helped me gain insights into the data. I also create hierarchies and custom groupings that enableS better analysis and visualization of the data.

- Data Visualization: In this step, I create interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards that enables me to analyze the Superstone sales data. I use Power BI's visualization tools to create charts, tables, and other visual elements that will help me gain insights into the data.

- Sales Analysis: In this step, I use the reports and dashboards created in the previous step to analyze the Superstone sales data. I explore the sales data by product categories, customer segments, and regions to identify trends and insights that can help Superstone improve its sales performance.

- Actionable Insights: In this step, I use the insights gained from the sales analysis to create actionable recommendations for Superstone. I also create a summary report that highlights the key findings of the analysis and provides recommendations for future action.

The project will help Superstone gain insights into its sales performance and identify areas where it can improve. The reports and dashboards created in Power BI will provide an interactive and visually appealing way to explore the data, making it easier for decision-makers to gain insights and take action. Overall, this project will demonstrate the power of Microsoft Power BI as a tool for data analysis and visualization.
